grid and tutor submits availability a scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring also there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project the other piece of this project is automated emails through scheduled task which runs every day responsibilities created a availability calendar grid in grid each cell represents time 1 hour span and day of the week clicking on the cell toggles the availability automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different databaseworked with data
