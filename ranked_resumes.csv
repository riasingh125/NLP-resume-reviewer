having the curriculum inclusive of each childs needs and interests name plan involving group work which is the key for the student led jobs and direction to help others teach respect for others and themselves motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically and sharing with the

missouri system faculty and students through agile and rapid creation of new applications projects atlas description this project is all about requesting scheduling the tutoring sessions there are three roles tied to application they are tutee tutor and name a tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that heshe enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through availability grid and tutor submits availability a scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring also there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project the other piece of this project is automated emails through scheduled task which runs every day responsibilities created a availability calendar grid in grid each cell represents time 1 hour span and day of the week clicking on the cell toggles the availability automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different databaseworked with data warehouse team in order to get that data developed c console application for scheduled email task got rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled created class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both console application for schedule task and web application integrated open source html text editor ckeditor into
